# Install-Golang
## Download the Go distribution for Linux from the official website. For example, you can use the following command to download Go version 1.18rc1:

```bash
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.18rc1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Extract the downloaded archive to the desired installation location. For example, you can use the following command to extract the archive to the `/usr/local` directory:
```bash
sudo tar -xvf go1.18rc1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
```
Add the Go `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable. For example, you can add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```
Verify the installation by checking the Go version. You should see the version number that you installed:
```bash
go version
```
### This will install the Go compiler and tools on your system. You can then use the `go` command to compile and run Go programs.

Note: The above instructions are for a Linux system. The installation process may be different for other operating systems. You can find the official installation instructions for other operating systems on the Go website.

In addition, the above instructions are for installing a specific version of Go (1.18rc1). If you want to install a different version, you can replace the version number in the `wget` command and the archive filename with the desired version number.
For example, to install Go version 1.17rc2, you can use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.17rc2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf go1.17rc2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go version
```
This will install Go version 1.17rc2 on your system. You can use the `go` command to compile and run Go programs with this version.
